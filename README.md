# KNN-Classifier-from-Scratch
In this repo we are building our KNN classifier from scratch without using Sklearn library.
We are creating our own random data points for apples and oranges. The data is randomly generated on the basis of Sweetness and Nutrition in both the fruits. Then the data points is plotted and visualized. Then we train our model using these data points in KNN Classifier and the we create our own random test point and predicted which fruit does that test point belongs to.
